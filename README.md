# MolSimReg.jl

Very rudimentary management utility for the [`MolSim` Julia registry](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/MolSim).

## Usage


## TODO

* Either parse the registry or remember the registered packages (that don't need to be forced) in a json file.
* implement automatic `git push`
* ... or even better, an automatic PR
